# CSS 1: Card Flip

*Background*: You've been working hard and it's time to show off your work! Build yourself a slick online portfolio to display your projects.

*Requirements*: Using the starter html, css, and images, do the following:

 - Adjust the position of the .primary and .secondary elements so that they are right on top of each other
 - Using opacity, adjust the CSS so that only .primary is visible
 - On hover, hide .primary and show .secondary
 - Set up a transition so that you have a smooth crossfade on hover
 - Switch your portfolio to use 3d rotations to produce a card-flip effect
